-- QUERIES
-- ------------
-- Query 1: List names and sellers of products that are no longer available (quantity=0)
-- Using merchants, products, and sell tables

    s.quantity_available as Quantity
from merchants m

select p.name as ProductName, p.description as Description
from products p

-- Query 5: What did Uriel Whitney order from Acer? (make sure to at least retrieve product names and prices).
-- I did this query before Dr. Forouraghi changed the question, and he said I can leave my previous answer....
	-- This query is a bit difficulty because our schema does not allow us to see which merchant supplied the product that Uriel Whitney purchased.
	-- Each product can be sold by multiple merchants, so we have no way of knowing which of the products that Uriel Whitney bought were from Acer.
-- This query answers the question: What items that Uriel Whitney ordered does Acer sell?
	-- This is as close as we can get with the current schema.

-- Query 6: List the annual total sales for each company (sort the results along the company and the year attributes).
-- The current schema does not allow us to answer this query specifically.
	-- This is because the current schema does not allow us to see which merchant supplied each product that was bought.
	-- The orders table tells us which products were purchased in each order, but not which merchant supplied the product.
-- The following query inflates totals when multiple merchants sell the same product, because `contain` does not store `mid`. 
	-- Results should be interpreted as potential revenue, not actual sales.

from orders
group by shipping_method
order by AvgCost
limit 1;


-- Query 9: What is the best sold ($) category for each company?
-- The current schema does not allow us to answer this query specifically.
	-- This is because the schema does not record which merchant actually fulfilled each purchased product.
	-- In addition, the schema does not record quantities sold, only quantities available for sale.
-- The following query therefore uses inventory data (price Ã— quantity_available from `sell`) to approximate revenue.
	-- Results should be interpreted as potential revenue, not actual sales.

-- Query 10: For each company, find out which customers have spent the most and the least amounts.
-- The current schema does not allow us to answer this query specifically.
	-- This is because `contain` does not store mid, so we cannot tell which merchant actually fulfilled the product.
-- The query assumes qty = 1 and uses prices from `sell`.
-- Totals are inflated when multiple merchants sell the same product, since each merchant is credited.
-- Results should be read as potential spend, not actual sales.
